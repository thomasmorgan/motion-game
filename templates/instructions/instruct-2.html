    <p>On real trials you won't get to see all of the movement, just a section of it. For instance, you might see the final 2 seconds. However, in addition, you will see a stuttery replay of the response submitted by a previous participant.</p>
    <p>You are taking part in this experiment as part of a long chain of participants, each of whom sees a different section of the true motion of the dot as well as a stuttery version of the previous participant's response. We are interested in whether, along the chain, participants will be able to pool knowledge and work out the entire motion.</p>

    <small><p>Note: The first participant receives only a section of a true motion as there are no earlier participants.</p></small>
