    <p>In this experiment you will reproduce the motion of a dot by moving your cursor around a canvas.</p>
    <p>Your accuracy is measured in terms of how accurately you reproduce the path and speed of the dot. The more accurate you are the bigger your bonus will be.</p>
    <p>On each trial you will first watch the dot moving. However, you won't see all of the movement, only a section of it. For instance, you might see the final 2 seconds. In addition, you will see a stuttery replay of the response submitted by a previous participant.</p>
